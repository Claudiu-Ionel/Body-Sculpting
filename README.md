## Testing

I used Mozilla web developer tools and Chrome developer tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.

Website was tested across multiple virtual devices and browsers with the help of the developer tools. I checked all supported devices and all the features are behaving and showing according to the screen size.

I also tested the website on my personal hardware: Xiaomi 12 pro that runs on Android 13.

### Performance Testing

I used [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) tool to check performance of the website and these are the results.

The biggest issues where related to performance and it was because I wasn't using an optimal format for images. As a solution I converted all of the images into **WebP**.

- W3C CSS Validator to validate CSS
- W3C validator to validate HTML
